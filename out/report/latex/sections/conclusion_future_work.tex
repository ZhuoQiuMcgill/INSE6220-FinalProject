We explored a lightweight surrogate for the Kepler koi\_score based on PCA and regression. The approach is simple to implement, leverages public KOI attributes, and produces predictions that can support screening and prioritization workflows. PCA provides a compact representation that can improve conditioning and interpretability, while non-linear models such as MLPs may offer accuracy gains when carefully tuned.

Future work includes enriching the feature set (e.g., additional stellar and transit-derived parameters), evaluating stronger non-linear regressors (e.g., gradient boosting or XGBoost), and exploring classification formulations for high/low-quality KOI triage. Integrating uncertainty estimation and calibration metrics would also help quantify risk when the surrogate is used in decision-making.
